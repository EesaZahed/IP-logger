# IP-logger
An IP logger that grabs IP addresses from a MongoDB Atlas database and displays them on an HTML table.

To run this project, clone this project locally and install all the node modules. Change the `url` in `app.js` to your MongoDB Atlas URl. If you do not have one, go [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/) to learn more about making one.

Next, run `node app.js` to view the IP logger.
